# Summary

Pendle is a yield-trading protocol that enables users to manage and optimize their yield exposure. By tokenizing yield-bearing assets into standardized yield tokens (SY), Pendle allows these assets to be split into principal tokens (PT) and yield tokens (YT). This separation facilitates various strategies, including earning fixed yields, speculating on future yield changes, and providing liquidity to earn additional rewards. Pendle's Automated Market Maker (AMM) is specifically designed to handle the trading of these assets.

# Ratings

## Chain

Pendle is deployed on various chains. This review is based on the Ethereum mainnet deployment of the protocol.

> Chain score: Low

## Upgradeability

The Pendle V2 protocol can be analyzed in a number of logical modules: _Yield Tokenization_, _Pendle AMM_, _vePENDLE, fees and incentives_ and _Governance_. Each module has upgradeable parts. Overall, these vectors could result in the _loss of user funds_, _loss of unclaimed yield_ or otherwise _materially affect the expected performance_ of the protocol. All the control vectors are held by the _Pendle Team_ with insufficient decentralisation and no distributed onchain Governance voting exists to this date. See the [Security Council Table](#security-council) for more details on the accounts that are the permission owners.

With the current setup the _Upgradeability Score_ is _High_. 

### Yield Tokenization

Yield Tokenization is the foundation of Pendle, converting yield-bearing assets into standardized yield (SY) tokens which are then split into Principal Tokens (PT) and Yield Tokens (YT). This separation allows users to trade yield or fix the yield for a duration.

The SY tokens themselves can be paused by the _Pendle Team_. Calling `pause` locks the supplied yield bearing assets in Pendle instantly without timelock protection. This could lead to permanent or temporary _loss of user funds_. Additionally, as a consequence of the smart contract infrastructure, during a paused SY token, trading between the associated YT and PT is paused.

The `Governance` multisig account can change the fee on the earned interest on any market instantenously up to 20% leaving YT holders no opportunity to exit their positions before enforcement of the new fee regiment. Existing positions are affected as well as newly created positions. Existing positions will receive when claiming, less yield than previously expected (_loss of unclaimed yield_). Currently this fee is 3% and is 100% re-directed to vePENDLE voters. The docs mention this is subject to change in the future.

The `PendleCommonSYFactory` is used to create new markets and instantiate the corresponding SY token. The implementation code used by the Factory to deploy new SY tokens can be updated by `Pendle: Deployer 1`, an EOA. Importantly, existing SY token contracts and user funds already deposited in the protocol are not affected by this upgradeability vector, as the implementation update only applies to new SY token deployments.

### Pendle AMM Module

Trading of PT and YT Tokens can be halted if the pause function on the SY token is called by the _Pendle Team_. If the pause is not resumed, PT owners can not claim the underlying asset at maturity, leading to _loss of user funds_. Likewise, the YT holders cannot claim the interest because of the paused SY token.

The _Pendle Team_ (`Governance multisig`) can update the trading fee for simple swaps and limit orders instantly. The fees are ultimately re-directed to the vePENDLE voters. If fees are reduced, the expected performance for vePENDLE voters might not hold true.

### PENDLE incentives for LPs and Fees for vePENDLE voters

The _vePENDLE, fees and incentives_ module handles voting, boosts and rewards.

#### PENDLE emissions to LPs

The `PendleVotingControllerUpg` contract manages the gauge voting system that determines PENDLE incentive distribution across pools. The _Pendle Team_ can completely upgrade this contract, or add and remove pools from receiving votes without timelock. A pool that has received votes but is removed before the epoch is finalized and voting results are broadcasted looses all promised PENDLE allocation (_loss of unclaimed yield_).

The `PendleGaugeControllerMainchainUpg` contract distributes PENDLE tokens pro rata as incentive for LPs to the markets on every market state change. The _Pendle Team_ can withdraw the PENDLE tokens from the `PendleGaugeControllerMainchainUpg` contract at any moment. As a consequence, the PENDLE tokens are not further distributed to the markets based on the voting they received. Already distributed PENDLE tokens cannot be withdrawn from the market contract, but future PENDLE incentives are less than expected.

Additionally the `PendleGaugeControllerMainchainUpg` is fully upgradeable and the logic of the updated contract can change future payouts of PENDLE to LPs which _materially affects the expected performance_ for the LPs of the protocol.

#### Redirection of Fees to vePENDLE voters

Charged fees from market activities are automatically sent to the `Treasury` multisig. The fees allocated for the vePENDLE holders are manually forwarded to the `PendleFeeDistributorV2Proxy` from the `Treasury` multisig account via the EOA `Hardware Deployer`. The collected fees can be withhold at any stage of the transfer from the Treasury to the vePENDLE holders. This could lead to _loss of unclaimed yield_.

The `PendleMultiTokenMerkleDistributor` allows vePENDLE holders to claim token rewards issued by third parties. The `PendleMultiTokenMerkleDistributor` contains is upgradeable by the `DevMultisig`. These functions allow replacing the contract implementation used to validate reward claims, without timelock or other protection. This could lead to _loss of unclaimed yield_.

> Upgradeability score: High

## Autonomy

Pendle deployment on Ethereum does not depend on any dependency. Please read the [Reviewer Notes](#reviewer-notes) to informed about the dependency risk on other chain deployments.

> Autonomy score: Low

## Exit Window

With the exception of the `PENDLE` token which implements a 7-day delay through the `initiateConfigChanges` function, most other protocol contracts can be upgraded or modified instantly without any delay or warning to users. 

> Exit window score: High

## Accessibility

Users can only access Pendle through a single user interface: [app.pendle.finance](https://app.pendle.finance). Currently, there is no backup solution in case the interface is shut down or users are censored.

> Accessibility score: High

## Conclusion

The Pendle V2 protocol falls into the N/A category and not Stage 0 due to the `sySwapper` contract which is not verified on public block explorers.

Despite this classification, our analysis shows that Pendle V2 protocol receives High centralization risk scores for Upgradeability, Exit Window, and Accessibility dimensions, and a low score for Autonomy.

To reach Stage 0, Pendle should first verify all its contracts on Etherscan. Then, to progress toward Stage 1, the protocol would need to: 1) assign permissions to an account that suffices the _Security Council requirements_ with at least 7 signers, a 51% threshold, and at least 50% publicly identified external signers; 2) implement timelock mechanisms for critical functions; and 3) improve accessibility by publishing the frontend code to IPFS or developing alternative interfaces.

# Reviewer Notes

⚠️ [sySwapper](https://etherscan.io/address/0x248087c69e72e211b7264720bf6cc5a954f98cde#code) is NOT verified on a public block explorer. For the `sySwapper` we currently rely on the technical documentation provided by the Pendle Team. As a consequence the full scope of permissions and their definitive impact cannot be assessed.

⚠️ The `PendlePYLpOracle`, essential for integrations by external protocols, is fully upgradeable and owned by the Governance multisig (2/4). The Governance multisig account can call `setBlockCycleNumerator` which can modifies TWAP calculations. This is a centralization risk introduced to protocols that integrate Pendle.

⚠️ The `BaseSplitCodeFactoryContract` creates large contracts by splitting their bytecode into two separate fragments that function together as a single logical entity. The resulting fragment contracts remain unverified on Etherscan, creating significant transparency issues as their source code is inaccessible to the public. This contract is controlled by the EOA "Pendle: Deployer 1" and is used to deploy contracts like `PendleMarketFactoryV3`.

⚠️ vePENDLE balances are synchronized across chains, to boost LP positions on other chains than mainnet. This requires LayerZero as a dependency. Such an analysis is included in the report on the respective alternative chain.

# Protocol Analysis

## Market Creation

The Pendle protocol utilizes a yield-bearing token wrapper (SY) which then is split into principal (PT) and yield (YT) components. The creation of a market that connects the 3 contracts is permissionless.

The `PendleCommonSYFactory` deploys Standardized Yield (SY) tokens via the `deploySY` function, using creation code registered with `setSYCreationCode`. While this factory is owned by the `Pendle: Deployer 1` EOA, the deployment of new SY tokens is permissionless with the `deploySY` function.

`PendleYieldContractFactory` enables the creation of Principal Token (PT) and Yield Token (YT) contracts through its `createYieldContract` function, which is also permissionless. This function can be called directly by users or programmatically via the `PendleCommonPoolDeployHelperV2` as part of a full pool deployment process which also deploys the market.

## Yield Tokenization Process

### Direct Minting

SY → PT+YT (`mintPyFromSy`)  
Users with existing SY tokens can convert them directly into PT and YT through the `PendleRouterV4`. The router passes the request to the `PendleYieldToken` contract, which receives the SY tokens and then calls its `mintPY` function on the YT contract. The `PendleYieldToken` contract mints YT tokens and requests the `PendlePrincipalToken` contract to mint the corresponding amount of PT tokens via `mintByYT`.

External tokens → PT+YT (`mintPyFromToken`)  
Users can also convert external tokens (such as ETH or USDe) in a single transaction. The `PendleRouterV4` first converts these tokens to SY via a deposit operation, then transfers the SY to the `PendleYieldToken` contract which proceeds to issue PT and YT tokens in the same manner.

In both cases, the `PendleYieldToken` contract serves as the vault for SY tokens and coordinates the creation of equal quantities of PT and YT. The `PendlePrincipalToken` contract does not hold any assets directly, while the `PendleYieldToken` contract retains all SY tokens as collateral.

Governance can interrupt this process by pausing SY operations, thus blocking deposits, withdrawals, and transfers and preventing the creation of new PT/YT.

### Redeem Underlying

SY → Underlying Assets (`redeemSyToToken`)  
Users can convert SY tokens back to the underlying assets through the `PendleRouterV4`. The router calls the respective SY contract's redeem function, which unwraps the SY token and returns the underlying asset (such as ETH, USDC, or wstETH) directly to the user. This process allows users to exit the Pendle ecosystem completely and reclaim their original assets.

![Direct Minting](./diagrams/pendle-v2-direct-minting.png)

## Providing Liquidity (LP)  

Users can add liquidity through the `addLiquiditySingleToken` function of `PendleRouterV4`, which delegates the operation to the `ActionAddRemoveLiqV3` contract. This process converts the deposited tokens to SY, uses a portion to acquire PT via `swapSyForExactPt`, and issues LP tokens representing a position in the PT/SY pool. Fees are collected and transferred to the Treasury via the Proxy contract.

Liquidity removal is performed via `removeLiquiditySingleToken`. The LP tokens are burned, the user receives their proportional share of SY and PT, the PT are converted to SY via `swapExactPtForSy`, and the SY are converted to underlying tokens. During both addition and removal, the `PendleGaugeController` contract distributes PENDLE rewards to the market and the user.

![LP to Market](./diagrams/pendle-v2-lp.png)

## AMM PT and YT Trading

### Trade PT

Principal Tokens can be minted indirectly through `PendleRouterV4` using swap functions, which delegate operations to the `ActionSwapPTV3` contract.

Buying PT:
Users can convert external tokens to PT in a single transaction using `swapExactTokenForPt`. The process involves tokenizing the external asset into SY tokens via the SY contract, then using these SY tokens in the `PendleMarket` to obtain PT. Unlike direct minting, this method acquires only PT without the corresponding YT. A portion of SY tokens is sent as fees to the `Treasury`.

Selling PT:
When redeeming PT for external tokens, users call `swapExactPtForToken`. The PT tokens are sent to the `PendleMarket` for conversion to SY tokens, which are then redeemed for the underlying asset. A portion of SY tokens is send as fees to the `Treasury`.

`Governance` can `pause` SY token transfers, which technically prevents all PT trading operations. This pause blocks essential SY functions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers) that are required for both buying PT (cannot convert assets to SY or transfer SY to markets) and selling PT (cannot convert received SY back to underlying assets). Users with PT positions would be unable to exit until governance reactivates the SY token.

![Trade PT](./diagrams/pendle-v2-trade-PT.png)

### Trade YT

Yield Tokens can be traded through the `PendleRouterV4` which delegates operations to the `ActionSwapYTV3` contract. Trading YT uses a sophisticated flash swap mechanism to enable buying or selling YT independently.

Buying YT:
Users can acquire YT tokens without holding PT via `swapExactTokenForYt`. The router converts the external tokens to SY tokens, then temporarily borrows additional SY from the `PendleMarketV3` contract. All SY are used to mint both PT and YT (as they must be created in equal quantities), but only the YT are kept for the user. The PT are immediately sold back to the market to repay the borrowed SY. A portion of SY is sent as fees to the `Treasury`.

Selling YT:
When selling YT via `swapExactYtForToken`, the router borrows an equivalent amount of PT from the market, combines them with the user's YT to redeem SY (as both tokens are needed to unlock the underlying asset), then returns a portion of the SY to the market to repay the borrowed PT. The remaining SY are converted to the desired output token. As with buying, fees are collected and sent to the `Treasury`.

These flash swap mechanisms allow users to gain exposure to yield alone (YT) without needing to manage the principal component (PT).

`Governance` can `pause` SY token transfers, which completely blocks YT trading mechanisms. This pause prevents all essential operations on SY tokens (deposits, withdrawals, and transfers) that are necessary for flash swap functionality. Without these operations, it becomes technically impossible to buy or sell YT, as the process requires converting tokens to SY, minting PT+YT, and combining PT+YT to release SY. Users holding YT find themselves unable to exit their positions until governance decides to reactivate transfers.

## Router System and Action Modules

The `PendleRouterV4` functions as the protocol's central interface hub, directing user interactions to specialized execution modules. This architecture employs a selector-based routing mechanism where each function call is mapped to one of seven dedicated action modules, each responsible for specific protocol operations.

The primary modules include `ActionAddRemoveLiqV3` for liquidity management in Pendle pools, `ActionSwapPTV3` for Principal Token exchange operations, and `ActionSwapYTV3` for Yield Token transactions. Supporting modules such as `ActionMiscV3` handle yield redemption, token conversions, and position exits, while `ActionSimple` provides core utility functions. Advanced functionalities are enabled through `ActionAggregator` for batched operations and `ActionLimitOrder` for conditional trades.

Unlike conventional proxies, the routing infrastructure of `PendleRouterV4` relies on `ActionStorageV4` to manage function selector mappings. With the owner permanently set to the zero address , this configuration is immutable.

## Limit Order System

The protocol implements a limit order system through the `PendleLimitRouter` contract, enabling conditional execution of trades based on predefined parameters. This mechanism uses a hash-based identification system to track each order's status, recording both remaining amounts and filled portions.

Users can create orders that execute only when specific price conditions are met and can cancel their orders individually or in batches. The system uses EIP-712 signatures for order validation and employs logarithmic calculations for fee determination. These fee parameters are configured via `setLnFeeRateRoots` by either `Governance` or the `hardwareDeployer`, while collected fees are directed to `Treasury1`.

## PENDLE incentives and Fees

### Fee Collection and Distribution Path

The protocol implements a multi-stage fee distribution architecture with distinct flows for different market types. Fee revenue generated through market operations flows into two separate Treasury multisig accounts: `Treasury1` (2/6 multisig) processes fees from pools created before October 8, 2024, while `Treasury2` (2/5 multisig) handles those from newer pools.

From these Treasury accounts, tokens follow a standardized conversion path. The `hardwareDeployer` EOA serves as an intermediary conversion agent, receiving tokens from both Treasury multisigs. This EOA transforms various token types into ETH through the `PendleRouterV4`, then directs this ETH to the `PendleFeeDistributorV2Proxy` for final distribution.

The `PendleFeeDistributorV2Proxy` functions as the distribution engine for rewards to vePENDLE holders. Under the `DevMultisig` (2/3) administration, this contract employs merkle proofs through `setMerkleRootAndFund` to validate claims while simultaneously receiving funds. Its architecture allows for protocol-specific allocations through `updateProtocolClaimable` and system upgrades via `upgradeToAndCall`.

The `hardwareDeployer` EOA maintains additional protocol functionalities with its `GUARDIAN` and `ALICE` roles in the `PendleGovernanceProxy`. These capacities include fee rate modifications through `setLnFeeRate` and operational controls.

In parallel, the legacy `PendleFeeDistributor` remains active under the control of an unidentified address (0xD9c9935f4BFaC33F38fd3A35265a237836b30Bd1). This contract continues to distribute USDC to users through a separate reward system not accountable to the current Treasury structure.

### PENDLE Emissions to LPs

The PENDLE token emission system operates through an interconnected contract architecture with dynamic reward distribution.

The emission cycle begins when the `PendleLiquidityIncentivesMultisig` claims newly minted PENDLE through `claimLiquidityEmissions` based on a predetermined schedule. The PENDLE token's parameters are protected by a 7-day timelock via `initiateConfigChanges`. These tokens then flow to `Governance`, which funds the `PendleGaugeControllerMainchainUpg` through the `fundPendle` function.

vePENDLE holders lock their PENDLE in the `VotingEscrowPendleMainchain` contract and direct incentives by voting on pool allocations through `vote(pools, weights)` in the `PendleVotingControllerUpg`. This contract verifies vePENDLE balances and manages configuration parameters including emission rates (`setPendlePerSec`) and pool eligibility (`addPool`, `removePool`).

The `PendleVotingControllerUpg` sends voting results to the `PendleGaugeControllerMainchainUpg` via `updateVotingResults`, which then allocates PENDLE rewards to `PendleMarketV3` contracts dynamically.

Finally, LPs can claim their accumulated rewards directly from `PendleMarketV3` contracts via `redeemRewards`, completing a system where incentives are continuously allocated in response to liquidity activity and governance decisions.

### Points Rewards

The `PendleMultiTokenMerkleDistributor` manages token points system rewards for vePENDLE holders through a monthly cycle. The system takes a snapshot of vePENDLE balances on the 20th of each month, with token distributions occurring approximately one week later. The `DevMultisig` (2/3) controls this contract.

The process uses the `setMerkleRoot` function to establish which addresses can claim which rewards, `upgradeToAndCall` to modify the implementation, and `transferOwnership` to transfer administrative control.

The `DevMultisig` can modify reward distributions through several mechanisms: changing which addresses receive rewards via `setMerkleRoot`, upgrading the contract implementation through `upgradeToAndCall`, and determining which token types are included in distributions. These parameters can be adjusted during the period between the monthly snapshot and distribution dates.

# Dependencies

The protocol has no external dependencies.

# Governance

![Upgradeability](./diagrams/pendle-v2-upgradeability.png)

The Pendle protocol implements a governance model where the `Governance` multisig (2/4) maintains extensive control over all protocol aspects through multiple mechanisms.

For direct token control, `Governance` controls the `PENDLE` token via `transferOwnership` authority and initiates parameter changes through `initiateConfigChanges` (with 7-day timelock protection). It also controls the vote-escrowed `vePENDLE` token via `transferGovernance`, which is the cornerstone of the protocol's voting mechanism.

Regarding core infrastructure, `Governance` holds the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` in `PendleGovernanceProxy`, enabling it to grant and revoke roles, upgrade the implementation, and pause critical protocol functions. The `PendleGovernanceProxy` in turn has direct control over `PendleMarketFactoryV3`, with capabilities to set fees and treasury addresses. Separately, `Governance` directly manages the `ProxyAdmin` contract, which specifically provides upgrade authority over `PendleCommonPoolDeployHelperV2` and `PendleLimitRouter`.

For reward system control, `Governance` directly manages both `PendleGaugeControllerMainchainUpg` and `PendleVotingControllerUpg` via `upgradeTo` and `transferOwnership` functions.

`Governance` also maintains authority over `PendleYieldContractFactory` via `transferOwnership` and controls cross-chain messaging through the `PendleMsgSendEndpointUpg` proxy. The multisig has assigned `GUARDIAN` and `ALICE` roles to the `hardwareDeployer` EOA, which enables this address to perform critical actions including pausing functions.

The only significant timelock protection in this governance structure is the 7-day delay on PENDLE token parameter changes, while other governance actions can be executed without delay. The `Timelock` contract receives the `initiateConfigChanges` call and enforces the waiting period before `applyConfigs` can be called, providing a security mechanism for token parameter modifications.

A malicious governance could potentially use this function to extract any Ether that somehow reached the contract address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PENDLE                            | withdrawToken            | This function allows governance to withdraw any ERC-20 token from the contract to a specified address. Similar to withdrawEther, it serves as a recovery mechanism for tokens that might be sent to the contract unintentionally, as the contract explicitly prevents direct PENDLE token transfers to itself. A malicious governance could use this to extract any ERC-20 tokens that might be held by the contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PENDLE                            | claimGovernance          | This function allows the pending governance address to claim control over the contract by updating the governance state variable. This completes the two-step governance transfer process, ensuring secure transition of administrative control. If the pending governance address is compromised, the attacker would gain control over all governance-restricted functions, including config changes and fund withdrawals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | pending owner not assigned                                     |   |
| PENDLE                            | transferGovernance       | This function initiates the process of transferring governance control by setting a new pending governance address. This is the first step in the two-phase ownership transfer mechanism designed to prevent accidental transfers. A compromised governance could designate a malicious entity as pending governance, starting the process of transferring all administrative control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PENDLE                            | initiateConfigChanges    | This function applies previously initiated configuration changes, but only after the mandatory 7-day timelock period has elapsed. This timelock mechanism provides a security buffer against malicious or erroneous configuration changes. If configuration changes were maliciously initiated, this function would make them effective after the timelock, potentially allowing manipulation of the token economics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PENDLE                            | claimLiquidityEmissions  | This function mints new PENDLE tokens according to the emission schedule and sends them to the liquidityIncentivesRecipient. This is the primary mechanism for distributing token rewards in the protocol's liquidity incentive program. If the incentives recipient is compromised, the attacker could claim all newly minted tokens meant for liquidity providers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | PendleLiquidityIncentivesMultisig                                              |   |
| BaseSplitCodeFactoryContract      | transferOwnership        | This function transfers ownership rights to a new address, either directly or by setting a pending owner depending on the parameters provided. The owner has exclusive privileges to deploy arbitrarily large contracts that can bypass standard EVM size limitations through the code-splitting technique. A malicious owner could transfer ownership to an untrusted entity who could then deploy malicious contracts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Pendle: Deployer 1                                                             |   |
| BaseSplitCodeFactoryContract      | claimOwnership           | This function allows the pending owner to claim ownership as the second step in the two-phase ownership transfer process with no waiting period or timelock. This function completes the ownership transfer giving the new owner complete control over the factory's deployment capabilities. If the pending owner address is compromised before the claim is executed, an attacker could immediately take control of the contract factory and deploy malicious large-scale contracts throughout the ecosystem.                                                                                                                                                                                           | Pendle: Deployer 1                                                             |   |
| BaseSplitCodeFactoryContract      | deploy                   | This function allows the owner to deploy contracts with creation code exceeding standard EVM size limits by splitting the code across two storage contracts. This capability enables the factory to deploy extremely large and complex contracts that would otherwise be impossible under Ethereum's size constraints. A malicious owner could deploy contracts with complex vulnerabilities or backdoors hidden within large bytecode, making them particularly difficult to audit and potentially enabling sophisticated attacks on the protocol.                                                                                                                                                       | Pendle: Deployer 1                                                             |   |
| PendleGovernanceProxy             | upgradeTo                | This function allows addresses with the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to upgrade the implementation of the UUPS proxy to a new contract address. This function is critical as it controls the entire logic of the contract and can fundamentally change how the system operates. A malicious admin could upgrade to a malicious implementation that could drain all funds, change permissions, or completely break the system's functionality with no timelock protection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleGovernanceProxy             | upgradeToAndCall         | This function allows addresses with the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to upgrade the implementation contract and immediately execute an initialization function on the new implementation. This powerful combination allows for atomic upgrades with initialization, which is necessary for complex system changes. A malicious admin could deploy and initialize a backdoored implementation that executes harmful logic immediately upon upgrade with no timelock or verification period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleGovernanceProxy             | grantRole                | This function enables addresses with the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to assign specific roles to any address in the system. Role-based access control is the foundation of the contract's security model, determining which addresses can perform sensitive actions. A malicious admin could grant critical roles like GUARDIAN or DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to compromised addresses, creating multiple attack vectors and potentially causing a complete security breakdown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleGovernanceProxy             | revokeRole               | This function allows addresses with the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to remove roles from any address in the system. This capability is essential for maintaining the security of the contract by removing privileges from compromised addresses. A malicious admin could revoke roles from legitimate operators, creating a denial of service by preventing authorized actions from being performed, disrupting the protocol's operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleGovernanceProxy             | aggregate                | This function allows addresses with ALICE, BOB, CHARLIE or DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to execute multiple contract calls in a single transaction, with non-admins restricted to pre-approved function selectors. This multicall capability enables efficient batch operations and complex contract interactions in a single transaction. A malicious actor with access to one of these roles could execute harmful combinations of allowed functions, potentially exploiting interactions between contract calls that might not be apparent when evaluating individual function permissions.                                                                                                                      | Governance, hardwareDeployer                                                   |   |
| PendleGovernanceProxy             | pause                    | This function enables addresses with the GUARDIAN or DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to pause multiple contracts implementing the IPPausingInterface in a single transaction. This emergency mechanism protects the system during attacks or when critical bugs are discovered by temporarily halting operations. A malicious guardian could inappropriately trigger a system-wide pause causing a denial of service, disrupting market operations and potentially trapping user funds until the system is unpaused.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Governance, hardwareDeployer                                                   |   |
| PendleGovernanceProxy             | setAllowedSelectors      | This function allows addresses with the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to configure which function selectors are permitted for use with the aggregate function by specific roles. This control mechanism restricts which contract functions can be called by which roles when using the batch execution capability. A malicious admin could assign dangerous function selectors to roles, allowing unauthorized operations that could compromise funds or critical protocol parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleGovernanceProxy             | \_authorizeUpgrade       | This internal function enforces that only addresses with the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE can authorize upgrades of the contract implementation. This is the core security check of the UUPS proxy pattern that protects against unauthorized upgrades. A compromised admin could authorize harmful upgrades, but the function itself has proper access control and functions as intended within the design of the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Governance                                                                     |   |
| ActionStorageV4                   | setSelectorToFacets      | This function allows the owner to modify the routing of function selectors to their respective implementations. The owner can redirect any function to any implementation without delay, which could enable insertion of malicious implementations. An attacker with access to this function could steal user funds, manipulate protocol behavior, or create catastrophic vulnerabilities by redirecting critical functions to compromised contracts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 0x0 (renounced)                                     |   |
| ActionStorageV4                   | transferOwnership        | This function initiates the two-step ownership transfer process by setting a pending owner address. The direct parameter also allows for immediate transfer, bypassing the two-step security mechanism. If compromised, an attacker could transfer ownership to a malicious address that would take control of the entire routing mechanism without any waiting period or timelock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 0x0 (renounced)                                     |   |
| ActionStorageV4                   | claimOwnership           | This function finalizes the two-step ownership transfer process, allowing the pending owner to claim full administrative control. If the pending owner address were compromised, an attacker could immediately gain complete control over the protocol's routing mechanism, potentially redirecting all functions to malicious implementations without any waiting period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 0x0 (renounced)                                     |   |
| PendlePYLpOracle                  | transferOwnership        | This function transfers ownership rights to a new address, either directly or through a two-step process depending on the parameters provided. The owner of this oracle has the ability to modify the blockCycleNumerator parameter which affects the TWAP calculations and oracle cardinality requirements. A malicious owner could set an invalid blockCycleNumerator that would cause the oracle to provide incorrect price data, potentially leading to mispriced assets across the Pendle protocol and financial losses for users.                                                                                                                                                                   | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendlePYLpOracle                  | claimOwnership           | This function allows the pending owner to claim ownership of the contract as the second step in the two-phase ownership transfer process. This function enables the secure transfer of critical oracle control without requiring direct handover. If the pending owner address is compromised before claiming ownership, an attacker could take control of the oracle and manipulate pricing data, potentially causing significant financial damage through improper asset valuations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | pending owner not assigned                                     |   |
| PendlePYLpOracle                  | setBlockCycleNumerator   | This function allows the owner to modify the blockCycleNumerator parameter which determines how the oracle calculates required cardinality for TWAP measurements. This parameter is critical for ensuring the oracle has sufficient historical data points to calculate accurate prices. A malicious owner could set this parameter inappropriately, causing the oracle to either require excessive cardinality (wasting gas) or insufficient cardinality (producing inaccurate price feeds), either of which could disrupt protocol operations.                                                                                                                                                          | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleYieldContractFactory        | transferOwnership        | This function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address through a two-step process where the new address must claim ownership. The owner controls critical parameters including fee rates, expiry divisor, and treasury address that affect the entire yield token ecosystem. A malicious owner could initiate a transfer to a compromised address which could then modify fee parameters up to their maximum values (20%) or redirect treasury funds to steal protocol revenue.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleYieldContractFactory        | setExpiryDivisor         | This function allows the owner to set the expiry divisor parameter which determines valid expiry timestamps for all yield contracts (expiry must be divisible by this value). This parameter directly impacts which yield contracts can be created and when they expire, affecting market liquidity and user positions. A malicious owner could set a disruptive divisor that prevents users from creating contracts with reasonable expiry periods, potentially forcing users into disadvantageous positions or breaking compatibility with existing systems.                                                                                                                                            | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleYieldContractFactory        | setInterestFeeRate       | This function allows the owner to adjust the interest fee rate (currently 3%) that applies to all yield accrued across the protocol, with a maximum cap of 20%. This fee directly impacts returns for all YT holders and revenue for expired unredeemed PTs in the system. A malicious owner could suddenly increase the fee to the maximum 20% threshold, capturing a substantial portion of users' yield and redirecting it to the treasury, potentially causing significant financial loss to users without any warning period.                                                                                                                                                                        | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleYieldContractFactory        | setRewardFeeRate         | This function allows the owner to modify the reward fee rate (currently 3%) charged on token rewards (including points) with a maximum cap of 20%. This fee determines what percentage of external rewards generated through the yield tokens is captured by the protocol. A malicious owner could increase this fee to the maximum allowed 20%, significantly reducing user rewards and potentially making certain yield strategies unprofitable, directly affecting user returns and liquidity incentives throughout the system.                                                                                                                                                                        | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleYieldContractFactory        | setTreasury              | This function allows the owner to change the treasury address that receives all protocol fees collected from interest and rewards. This address accumulates significant value over time as it receives a percentage of all yield generated across the protocol. A malicious owner could change the treasury address to a personal wallet or compromised contract, redirecting all future protocol revenue away from the intended recipient (currently 0x8270400d528c34e1596EF367eeDEc99080A1b592) and stealing funds that should benefit the protocol and its stakeholders.                                                                                                                               | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleMarketFactoryV3             | transferOwnership        | This function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address, either directly or through a two-step process depending on parameters. The owner has complete control over critical protocol parameters including treasury address and fee configurations that directly impact revenue distribution. A malicious owner could transfer control to a compromised address without any timelock, allowing immediate manipulation of fees and treasury addresses to divert protocol revenue.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | PendleGovernanceProxy                                                          |   |
| PendleMarketFactoryV3             | claimOwnership           | This function allows the pending owner address to claim control of the contract, completing the two-step ownership transfer process. This final step of ownership transfer grants all administrative privileges to the new address without any waiting period. If the pending owner address were compromised, the attacker would immediately gain full control over all critical protocol parameters, including fee configuration and revenue direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | pending owner not assigned                                     |   |
| PendleMarketFactoryV3             | setTreasuryAndFeeReserve | This function simultaneously updates the treasury address that receives protocol fees and the reserve fee percentage, without timelock protection. The treasury receives a portion of all trading fees from Pendle markets, making this function critical for protocol revenue management. A malicious owner could redirect fee revenue to a malicious address and maximize the reserve fee percentage to 100%, diverting all protocol fees meant for legitimate stakeholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | PendleGovernanceProxy                                                          |   |
| PendleMarketFactoryV3             | setOverriddenFee         | This function allows the owner to set a custom fee rate for specific router and market combinations that overrides the default fee. This creates flexibility in fee structures for different markets and can be used to create preferential fee tiers for strategic partnerships. A malicious owner could set artificially low fees for specific markets to drain liquidity from other markets or create fee arbitrage opportunities that could be exploited by affiliated addresses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | PendleGovernanceProxy                                                          |   |
| PendleLimitRouter                 | setFeeRecipient          | This function changes the address that receives all protocol fees collected from limit order executions. The fee recipient is the destination for all revenue generated by the protocol based on the fee rates set by setLnFeeRateRoots. A malicious owner could instantly redirect all protocol fee revenue to a controlled address, immediately diverting the revenue stream with no timelock or governance vote required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleLimitRouter                 | setOwnerHelper           | This function allows the owner to set a new address as the ownerHelper, which has equivalent permissions to the owner for specific functions like setLnFeeRateRoots. The ownerHelper creates a dual control mechanism for certain critical parameter changes in the protocol. If compromised, an attacker with owner privileges could set a malicious ownerHelper, bypassing the dual control security measure, with no timelock protection in place to prevent immediate execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleLimitRouter                 | setLnFeeRateRoots        | This function updates the logarithmic fee rate parameters for specific Yield Token addresses, directly impacting the fee calculation for limit orders in the protocol. Either the owner or ownerHelper can call this function, with fee rates having a hard-coded maximum value to prevent extreme settings. If misused, an attacker with either owner or ownerHelper privileges could immediately set fees to their maximum allowed values, extracting excessive value from users without any timelock delay.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Governance, hardwareDeployer                                                   |   |
| PendleLimitRouter                 | transferOwnership        | This function initiates the first step of the two-phase ownership transfer process by setting a pending owner address. This function controls who will have future administrative control over the entire protocol, including all privileged functions. If compromised, an attacker could initiate a transfer to a malicious address which could then claim ownership, with no timelock or delay protecting this critical administrative change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleLimitRouter                 | claimOwnership           | This function completes the two-phase ownership transfer process, allowing the pending owner to claim full administrative control. The claimOwnership function can only be called by the address set as pendingOwner, creating a security check for ownership transfers. If the pendingOwner address were compromised (currently set to address zero), an attacker could immediately claim full control over the protocol without any timelock or waiting period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | pending owner not assigned                                     |   |
| ProxyAdmin                        | transferOwnership        | This function transfers the ownership of the ProxyAdmin contract to a new address. The owner has complete control over proxy upgrades and admin changes for all proxies managed by this contract. A malicious owner could upgrade proxies to malicious implementations, potentially stealing user funds or permanently breaking functionality of all associated contracts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Governance                                                                     |   |
| ProxyAdmin                        | renounceOwnership        | This function allows the current owner to relinquish control of the contract by setting the owner to the zero address. Once ownership is renounced, all admin functions become permanently inaccessible, making the proxies effectively non-upgradable. If executed mistakenly or maliciously, this could permanently freeze all proxy contracts in their current implementation with no possibility of future upgrades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Governance                                                                     |   |
| ProxyAdmin                        | changeProxyAdmin         | This function changes the admin of a specific proxy contract to a new address. The admin of a proxy has exclusive rights to upgrade that proxy's implementation. A malicious owner could transfer admin rights of critical proxies to compromised addresses, creating multiple vulnerable points or fragmenting admin control across the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Governance                                                                     |   |
| ProxyAdmin                        | upgrade                  | This function upgrades a proxy to point to a new implementation contract. This capability is the core of upgradeable contract systems, allowing logic to be modified while preserving state and contract addresses. A malicious owner could upgrade proxies to implementations with backdoors or vulnerabilities, potentially allowing theft of funds or manipulation of critical protocol parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Governance                                                                     |   |
| ProxyAdmin                        | upgradeAndCall           | This function upgrades a proxy to a new implementation and immediately calls an initialization function on the new implementation. This atomic upgrade+initialize pattern is essential for complex upgrades that require state migrations or parameter settings. A malicious owner could use this to deploy and immediately execute harmful logic, such as draining funds or manipulating state variables in a single transaction without any delay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleCommonPoolDeployHelperV2    | transferOwnership        | This function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address. If transferred to a malicious actor, they would gain control over the helper contract, potentially allowing them to alter market deployment parameters or configurations. However, this doesn't directly affect existing markets, only future deployments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Pendle: Deployer 1                                                             |   |
| PendleCommonSYFactory             | transferOwnership        | This function allows the current owner to transfer ownership of the SY Factory to a new address. If transferred to a malicious actor, they would gain control over the factory, allowing them to register malicious creation codes for SY tokens. This could lead to compromised SY tokens being deployed by users of the protocol, potentially resulting in fund loss when users interact with these tokens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Pendle: Deployer 1                                                             |   |
| PendleCommonSYFactory             | setSYCreationCode        | This function allows the owner to register implementation code for new SY tokens of different types (identified by bytes32 id). A malicious owner could register creation code that contains backdoors or vulnerabilities. When users deploy new SY tokens through this factory, those tokens would contain the malicious code, potentially leading to loss of funds for users who deposit assets into these SY tokens. This is particularly high risk as it directly impacts the code that handles user assets.                                                                                                                                                                                          | Pendle: Deployer 1                                                             |   |
| PendleERC4626SYV2 (Example SY)       | pause                    | This function allows the owner to pause all activities on the SY token, including deposits, redemptions, and transfers. When paused, users cannot deposit new assets, redeem their shares for underlying assets, or transfer their SY tokens. This could temporarily freeze user funds, preventing them from accessing their assets during critical market conditions when they might need liquidity the most.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | PendleGovernanceProxy                                                          |   |
| PendleERC4626SYV2 (Example SY)       | unpause                  | This function allows the owner to resume operations after the contract has been paused. While this function itself isn't risky, it complements the pause function by giving the owner control over when to restore access to user funds. The owner could potentially use selective timing of unpausing to benefit certain users or strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | PendleGovernanceProxy                                                          |   |
| PendleERC4626SYV2 (Example SY)       | transferOwnership        | This function allows the current owner to transfer control of the SY token to a new address. If ownership is transferred to a malicious actor, they would gain the ability to pause the contract and block users from accessing their funds. Since this function can indirectly lead to user funds being frozen via the pause mechanism, it represents a significant risk to the protocol's users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | PendleGovernanceProxy                                                          |   |
| VotingEscrowPendleMainchain       | addDestinationContract   | This function adds new destination contracts for synchronizing vePENDLE balances from Ethereum to other chains. This capability is critical for enabling LP reward boosts cross-chain, allowing users to apply their vePENDLE voting power benefits on secondary chains without re-locking their tokens. A malicious owner could add compromised destination contracts that would incorrectly synchronize vePENDLE balances, preventing users from receiving their rightful LP reward boosts or manipulating reward distributions on secondary chains.                                                                                                                                                    | Governance                                                                     |   |
| VotingEscrowPendleMainchain       | setApproxDstExecutionGas | This function sets the approximated gas amount required for executing cross-chain vePENDLE synchronization messages. This parameter directly impacts the cost users must pay when broadcasting their vePENDLE positions to secondary chains to activate their LP reward boosts. A malicious owner could set excessively high gas estimates to make cross-chain synchronization prohibitively expensive, effectively preventing users from accessing their rightful LP reward boosts on other chains, or set it too low causing synchronization failures.                                                                                                                                                  | Governance                                                                     |   |
| VotingEscrowPendleMainchain       | transferOwnership        | This function initiates the transfer of contract ownership by setting the pendingOwner address. This is the first step in the two-phase ownership transfer pattern that controls administrative access to critical vePENDLE cross-chain infrastructure. A malicious owner could transfer ownership to a compromised address, giving it complete control over which chains can receive vePENDLE data and how gas costs are calculated, potentially disrupting the entire cross-chain reward boost system for all users.                                                                                                                                                                                    | Governance                                                                     |   |
| VotingEscrowPendleMainchain       | claimOwnership           | This function allows the pending owner to claim full ownership of the contract, completing the second step of the ownership transfer process. This function finalizes the transfer of all administrative rights over the vePENDLE cross-chain infrastructure, including the ability to add or remove destination chains. Currently, this function presents no immediate risk as pendingOwner is set to the zero address, making it impossible for anyone to successfully call this function.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | pending owner not assigned                                     |   |
| PendleMsgSendEndpointUpg          | setWhitelisted           | This function configures which addresses are allowed to send cross-chain messages through LayerZero. This whitelisting is essential for securing the vePENDLE cross-chain synchronization system, ensuring only authorized contracts can broadcast position data to other chains. A malicious owner could whitelist unauthorized contracts that might send incorrect vePENDLE position data, potentially preventing users from receiving their legitimate LP reward boosts on secondary chains.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleMsgSendEndpointUpg          | transferOwnership        | This function initiates the transfer of contract ownership to a new address by setting the pendingOwner. This role controls all administrative aspects of the cross-chain messaging system used to synchronize vePENDLE balances across chains. A malicious owner could transfer control to a compromised address, enabling manipulation of the cross-chain communication infrastructure that vePENDLE users rely on exclusively for their LP reward boosts on secondary chains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleMsgSendEndpointUpg          | upgradeTo                | This function allows the owner to upgrade the implementation contract of the proxy, changing the fundamental logic of the cross-chain messaging system. This upgradeability is necessary for maintenance and improvements to the vePENDLE cross-chain infrastructure. A malicious owner could upgrade to an implementation that incorrectly synchronizes vePENDLE balances or introduces vulnerabilities, disrupting the cross-chain LP reward boost system, which is the only vePENDLE functionality available on secondary chains.                                                                                                                                                                      | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleMsgSendEndpointUpg          | addReceiveEndpoints      | This function registers new destination contracts on other chains that can receive vePENDLE position data. This capability is essential for expanding vePENDLE's cross-chain LP boosting functionality to new blockchains. A malicious owner could add incorrect or compromised receive endpoints, causing vePENDLE position synchronization to fail or be routed to the wrong destination contracts, preventing users from receiving their boost benefits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleMsgSendEndpointUpg          | setLzSendVersion         | This function updates the version of the LayerZero protocol used for sending cross-chain messages. This adaptation capability is necessary to maintain compatibility with LayerZero as the underlying protocol evolves. A malicious owner could set an incompatible version, causing vePENDLE position synchronization failures and preventing users from receiving their LP reward boosts on secondary chains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleMsgSendEndpointUpg          | \_authorizeUpgrade       | This internal function verifies that only the owner can authorize contract upgrades, providing a security check for the UUPS upgrade pattern. This authorization is a critical safeguard protecting the integrity of the vePENDLE cross-chain infrastructure. A compromised owner could bypass this protection, potentially implementing changes that disrupt the vePENDLE cross-chain synchronization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleMsgSendEndpointUpg          | sendMessage              | This function transmits vePENDLE position data to other blockchains through LayerZero, but only whitelisted contracts can call it. This function is the core mechanism that enables vePENDLE holders to synchronize their positions to secondary chains for LP reward boosts. If a malicious contract were whitelisted, it could potentially send incorrect vePENDLE data to other chains, causing incorrect reward boost calculations for users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Whitelisted Addresses (VotingEscrowPendleMainchain, PendleVotingControllerUpg) |   |
| PendleVotingControllerUpg         | upgradeTo                | This function upgrades the implementation of the contract to a new address, changing the core logic that manages the gauge voting system for vePENDLE. This capability allows the protocol to evolve and fix bugs in the critical voting infrastructure that controls PENDLE incentive distribution across pools. A malicious owner could upgrade to a malicious implementation that redirects PENDLE rewards to compromised pools or manipulates voting weights, potentially funneling millions in incentives to their own pools.                                                                                                                                                                        | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleVotingControllerUpg         | addDestinationContract   | This function registers new destination contracts on other chains to receive cross-chain voting results from Ethereum. This cross-chain capability allows vePENDLE voting results to influence PENDLE incentive distribution on secondary chains like Arbitrum. A malicious owner could add unauthorized or compromised destination contracts, enabling the misrouting of gauge voting data to attacker-controlled contracts on other chains, which could then distribute incentives incorrectly.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleVotingControllerUpg         | transferOwnership        | This function initiates the transfer of contract ownership to a new address by setting the pendingOwner. This ownership transfer controls who has administrative privileges over the entire vePENDLE voting and incentive distribution system. A malicious actor gaining ownership could manipulate the incentive distribution framework, add malicious pools, redirect PENDLE rewards, and potentially compromise the entire protocol's tokenomics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleVotingControllerUpg         | addPool                  | This function adds a new pool to the voting system, allowing vePENDLE holders to direct PENDLE incentives to it. This capability enables the protocol to expand liquidity incentives to new markets and assets as they are added to the platform. A malicious owner or poolHelper could add a compromised or fake pool contract to the voting system, allowing PENDLE incentives to be directed to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Governance, hardwareDeployer                                                   |   |
| PendleVotingControllerUpg         | addMultiPools            | This function adds multiple pools to the voting system simultaneously, enabling efficient expansion of the incentivized pool set. This batch functionality reduces transaction costs and simplifies the administration of the protocol's incentive framework. A malicious owner or poolHelper could add several compromised pools at once, rapidly scaling an attack on the incentive system and potentially directing significant amounts of PENDLE rewards to attacker-controlled markets.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Governance, hardwareDeployer                                                   |   |
| PendleVotingControllerUpg         | removePool               | This function removes a pool from the voting system, preventing vePENDLE holders from directing further incentives to it. This capability is necessary for managing the incentive system when pools become deprecated or need to be phased out. A malicious owner or poolHelper could remove legitimate, high-performing pools from receiving incentives, disrupting the protocol's liquidity and potentially causing significant losses to users who positioned themselves based on expected incentives.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Governance, DevMultisig                                                        |   |
| PendleVotingControllerUpg         | forceBroadcastResults    | This function allows broadcasting voting results to destination chains with specific parameters, bypassing normal checks. This override capability provides a failsafe mechanism in case of cross-chain message failures or other exceptional circumstances. A malicious owner could broadcast manipulated voting results with arbitrary values, incorrectly allocating PENDLE incentives across chains and potentially redirecting rewards to compromised pools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleVotingControllerUpg         | setPendlePerSec          | This function sets the rate at which PENDLE tokens are distributed as incentives across all pools per second. This parameter directly controls the emission rate of the protocol's incentive system and the overall inflation rate of PENDLE. A malicious owner could set an excessively high rate, leading to hyperinflation of PENDLE, or reduce it to zero, completely halting rewards and potentially causing a mass exodus of liquidity from all pools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleVotingControllerUpg         | setAddPoolHelper         | This function sets the address that has permission to add pools to the voting system alongside the owner. This delegation mechanism allows operational flexibility by permitting a trusted entity to manage pool additions without full ownership rights. A malicious owner could set a compromised address as the poolHelper, giving an attacker persistent ability to add unauthorized pools to the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleVotingControllerUpg         | setRemovePoolHelper      | This function sets the address that has permission to remove pools from the voting system alongside the owner. This delegation mechanism allows operational flexibility by permitting a trusted entity to manage pool removals without full ownership rights. A malicious owner could set a compromised address as the removePoolHelper, enabling an attacker to disable legitimate pools and disrupt the protocol's incentive distribution at will.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleVotingControllerUpg         | setApproxDstExecutionGas | This function sets the approximate gas amount needed for cross-chain message execution when broadcasting voting results. This parameter affects the cost and reliability of the cross-chain communication that synchronizes vePENDLE voting results to secondary chains. A malicious owner could set this value inappropriately high, wasting protocol funds on transaction fees, or dangerously low, causing cross-chain messages to fail and preventing proper incentive distribution on secondary chains.                                                                                                                                                                                              | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleGaugeControllerMainchainUpg | redeemMarketReward       | This function allows a pool market to claim its allocated PENDLE rewards based on the voting results and time elapsed since the last claim. This mechanism distributes incentives to pools according to the vePENDLE holders' votes, ensuring that markets receive the correct amount of rewards they are entitled to. If exploited through a compromised market contract, it could potentially claim rewards it's not entitled to, though this risk is mitigated by the validation checks ensuring only legitimate markets from approved factories can call this function.                                                                                                                               | Legitimate Markets (verified by marketFactory)                                 |   |
| PendleGaugeControllerMainchainUpg | withdrawPendle           | This function allows the owner to withdraw any amount of PENDLE tokens from the contract to any specified address. This capability serves as an emergency function to recover funds or redirect rewards in exceptional circumstances, giving governance complete control over the protocol's incentive reserves. A malicious owner could drain all PENDLE rewards from the contract in a single transaction, permanently halting all incentive distributions to pools and causing significant harm to liquidity providers who depend on these rewards.                                                                                                                                                    | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleGaugeControllerMainchainUpg | \_authorizeUpgrade       | This internal function verifies that only the owner can authorize an upgrade to the contract implementation, serving as a security check in the UUPS upgrade pattern. This authorization mechanism is essential for protecting the integrity of the contract's upgrade process, ensuring only governance can change the core functionality. A compromised owner could authorize an upgrade to a malicious implementation that redirects rewards, manipulates the distribution logic, or adds backdoors to steal future deposits of PENDLE rewards.                                                                                                                                                        | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleGaugeControllerMainchainUpg | upgradeTo                | This function upgrades the implementation of the contract to a new address, changing the core logic that handles PENDLE reward distribution to markets. This upgradeability allows the protocol to evolve and improve its incentive distribution mechanisms or fix bugs without disrupting the system's state or stored rewards. A malicious owner could upgrade to a compromised implementation that misallocates rewards, creates unfair distribution, or contains deliberate vulnerabilities that allow theft of the contract's PENDLE reserves.                                                                                                                                                       | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleGaugeControllerMainchainUpg | transferOwnership        | This function initiates the transfer of contract ownership to a new address by setting the pendingOwner, implementing the first step of a two-phase ownership transfer pattern. This controlled ownership transfer process determines who will have full administrative control over the PENDLE reward distribution system and its significant treasury of tokens. A malicious actor could transfer ownership to a compromised address, giving it permanent control over reward distribution and the ability to withdraw all protocol incentives, potentially destroying the economic incentives that maintain liquidity across all Pendle markets.                                                       | Governance                                                                     |   |
| PendleGaugeControllerMainchainUpg | updateVotingResults      | This function receives and processes voting results from the PendleVotingControllerUpg, updating the reward distribution rates for each market based on vePENDLE holder votes. This core mechanism implements the incentive allocation, ensuring that PENDLE rewards are distributed to markets according to the collective decisions of vePENDLE holders. If the PendleVotingControllerUpg contract were compromised, it could manipulate voting results to direct disproportionate rewards to specific markets, potentially disrupting the fair distribution of incentives and the resulting liquidity across the protocol.                                                                             | PendleVotingControllerUpg                                                      |   |
| PendleMultiTokenMerkleDistributor | transferOwnership        | This function initiates the transfer of contract ownership to a new address by setting the pendingOwner variable, implementing the first step of a two-phase ownership transfer pattern. This controlled ownership change process determines who will have administrative control over the monthly vePENDLE reward distributions across multiple token types. A malicious owner could initiate a transfer to a compromised address right before the monthly distribution occurs, potentially allowing the new owner to redirect an entire month's worth of rewards across multiple tokens once ownership is claimed.                                                                                      | DevMultisig                                                                    |   |
| PendleMultiTokenMerkleDistributor | claimOwnership           | This function completes the second phase of the ownership transfer process, allowing the pending owner to claim full administrative control over the contract that manages monthly token distributions. This transaction finalizes the change of ownership, transferring all privileged capabilities to update the merkle root and control the distribution of rewards generated from the monthly vePENDLE snapshots. If executed by a malicious actor during the critical week between the vePENDLE snapshot (20th) and distribution, they could immediately alter the merkle root to redirect that month's rewards, potentially affecting all vePENDLE holders and multiple token types simultaneously. | pending owner not assigned                                     |   |
| PendleMultiTokenMerkleDistributor | upgradeTo                | This function replaces the implementation address of the contract, allowing the entire logic of the monthly vePENDLE rewards distribution to be changed while preserving all claiming history. This upgradeability enables the protocol to improve the distribution mechanism or fix bugs without disrupting the monthly reward cycle that vePENDLE holders depend on. If this function were called maliciously during the week between snapshot and distribution, an attacker could deploy a compromised implementation that redirects the entire month's rewards across all token types to specific addresses, potentially causing a catastrophic loss for all vePENDLE holders.                        | DevMultisig                                                                    |   |
| PendleMultiTokenMerkleDistributor | setMerkleRoot            | This function updates the merkle root that validates which vePENDLE holders can claim which tokens based on the monthly snapshot taken on the 20th. This cryptographic mechanism defines the entire reward distribution for all token types without requiring on-chain storage of the complete distribution data for potentially thousands of vePENDLE holders. If called with a manipulated root during the week after the snapshot, a malicious owner could create an illegitimate distribution scheme that diverts the monthly rewards to specific addresses, potentially stealing an entire month's worth of incentives across multiple token types from legitimate vePENDLE holders.                 | DevMultisig                                                                    |   |
| PendleMultiTokenMerkleDistributor | upgradeToAndCall         | This function not only upgrades the implementation contract but also executes arbitrary function calls during the upgrade process. This powerful mechanism allows for complex migrations that can update the distribution logic while simultaneously initializing new variables or executing configuration changes needed for the monthly reward system. If exploited just before a scheduled distribution, an attacker could deploy a malicious implementation with initialization code that immediately transfers all accumulated token rewards to attacker-controlled addresses, potentially stealing multiple tokens in a single atomic transaction before anyone could react to the upgrade.         | DevMultisig                                                                    |   |
| PendleMultiTokenMerkleDistributor | \_authorizeUpgrade       | This internal function verifies that only the owner can authorize an upgrade to the contract implementation, serving as a security check in the UUPS upgrade pattern. This authorization mechanism protects the integrity of the monthly distribution system, ensuring only governance can change how vePENDLE holders receive their periodic rewards. If the owner is compromised during the predictable vulnerability window between snapshot and distribution, this function would allow authorization of a malicious upgrade that could target the pending monthly rewards, potentially affecting all vePENDLE holders and multiple token types in a single strategic attack.                         | DevMultisig                                                                    |   |
| PendleFeeDistributor              | transferOwnership        | This function initiates the transfer of contract ownership to a new address by setting the pendingOwner variable in the original fee distribution system that distributes rewards in tokens (such as USDC). This version is still active but considered legacy as the protocol has migrated to FeeDistributorV2 for ETH-based fee distribution. A malicious actor with ownership could redirect all fees to manipulated pools, potentially draining accumulated token rewards that have not yet been claimed by vePENDLE holders.                                                                                                                                                                         | Unknown Address                                                                |   |
| PendleFeeDistributor              | claimOwnership           | This function completes the ownership transfer process in the legacy token-based fee distribution system, allowing the address set as pendingOwner to claim full ownership rights. If compromised, an attacker could modify how accumulated protocol fees in tokens are distributed to early vePENDLE holders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | pending owner not assigned                                     |   |
| PendleFeeDistributor              | upgradeTo                | This function upgrades the implementation contract of the legacy token-based fee distributor to a new address, affecting the distribution mechanism for protocol-collected tokens across weekly epochs. The upgradeability mechanism in this V1 version differs significantly from the FeeDistributorV2, which uses Merkle proofs for distributing native ETH fees rather than tokens over time-based epochs. A malicious upgrade could compromise the remaining token rewards still managed by this legacy system.                                                                                                                                                                                       | Unknown Address                                                                |   |
| PendleFeeDistributor              | addPool                  | This function adds a new pool to the legacy token-based fee distribution system, which uses weekly epochs and vePENDLE voting history. Despite being the older version, this system still controls distribution of certain token rewards to pools based on historical vePENDLE balances. A malicious owner could disrupt this system by adding illegitimate pools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Unknown Address                                                                |   |
| PendleFeeDistributor              | fund                     | This function manages token-based fee allocation across various time periods in the legacy system. A malicious owner could manipulate the remaining token distributions in this partially deprecated system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Unknown Address                                                                |   |
| PendleFeeDistributorV2            | transferOwnership        | This function initiates the transfer of contract ownership to a new address by setting a pendingOwner, implementing the first step of a two-phase ownership transfer pattern. This controlled transfer process ensures that administrative control over the protocol fee distribution can be safely passed to new governance or multisig setups as the protocol evolves. A compromised owner could initiate transfer to a malicious address that, once ownership is claimed, could drain all accumulated fees and permanently corrupt the distribution system.                                                                                                                                            | DevMultisig                                                                    |   |
| PendleFeeDistributorV2            | claimOwnership           | This function completes the second phase of ownership transfer initiated by transferOwnership, allowing the pending owner to claim full administrative control over the contract. This transaction finalizes the ownership change, transferring all privileged capabilities to control fee distribution, upgrade logic, and manage the contract's funds. If the pending owner's private key is compromised after transferOwnership is called but before claimOwnership executes, an attacker could permanently hijack the contract's administration, gaining full control over all fee distribution mechanisms and accumulated funds.                                                                     | pending owner not assigned                                     |   |
| PendleFeeDistributorV2            | upgradeToAndCall         | This function not only upgrades the implementation contract but also executes arbitrary function calls with provided data during the upgrade process. This powerful mechanism allows for complex migrations that can update the contract logic while simultaneously initializing new state variables or executing configuration changes in a single transaction. If compromised, an attacker could deploy a malicious implementation and simultaneously execute harmful initialization logic, potentially exploiting the atomicity of the upgrade to bypass security checks or drain funds before users can react.                                                                                        | DevMultisig                                                                    |   |
| PendleFeeDistributorV2            | setMerkleRootAndFund     | This function updates the merkle root that validates user reward claims and simultaneously adds funds to the contract for distribution. This critical mechanism determines how protocol fees are distributed to users based on their LP positions and allows the contract to receive ETH for future distributions. If compromised, the owner could set an invalid merkle root that prevents legitimate users from claiming their rewards while redirecting funds to specified addresses, potentially stealing protocol fees intended for liquidity providers.                                                                                                                                             | DevMultisig                                                                    |   |
| PendleFeeDistributorV2            | updateProtocolClaimables | This function enables bulk updates to the claimable token amounts for multiple protocol integrations in a single transaction. This batch processing capability allows the owner to efficiently manage reward distributions across various integrated protocols without having to execute individual transactions for each update. A malicious owner could manipulate protocol rewards on a massive scale in a single transaction, potentially allocating excessive amounts to compromised addresses while simultaneously reducing legitimate allocations, making it difficult to detect the fraud until after funds have been claimed.                                                                    | DevMultisig                                                                    |   |
| PendleFeeDistributorV2            | updateProtocolClaimable  | This function updates the claimable amounts for specific protocol pools, allowing the owner to distribute fees to advanced protocol integrations that can't use the retail claiming flow. This mechanism enables institutional or protocol-level LP providers to receive their fair share of protocol fees through a different validation process. If misused, the owner could allocate excessive rewards to specific protocol addresses, unfairly distributing fees away from retail users who rely on the merkle proofs for verification.                                                                                                                                                               | DevMultisig                                                                    |   |
| PendleFeeDistributorV2            | \_authorizeUpgrade       | This internal function verifies that only the owner can authorize an upgrade to the contract implementation, serving as a security check in the UUPS upgrade pattern. This authorization mechanism is essential for protecting the integrity of the contract's upgrade process, ensuring only governance can change the core functionality. A compromised owner could authorize an upgrade to a malicious implementation that redirects rewards, manipulates the distribution logic, or adds backdoors to steal future deposits of ETH rewards.                                                                                                                                                           | DevMultisig                                                                    |   |
