# Summary

Uniswap v3 is an AMM that builds upon Uniswap v2 by introducing a concentrated liquidity model, providing liquidity providers with granular control over capital allocation. Unlike v2, where liquidity is distributed uniformly across all price ranges, v3 allows LPs to specify custom price ranges in which their liquidity is active. This approach significantly improves capital efficiency, as LPs can concentrate their assets in high-demand price ranges, earning fees only within those specified ranges.
Uniswap v3 also introduces multiple fee tiers (0.01%, 0.05%, 0.3%, and 1%) to support different asset volatility profiles, allowing LPs to adjust their fee preferences based on expected risk and return. Additionally, it incorporates "range orders," which effectively turn liquidity positions into limit orders, further enhancing LP strategy flexibility.
The protocol is deployed across multiple chains enabling a wide range of use cases across decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.


# Overview

## Chain

Uniswap v3 is deployed on various chains. This review is based on the Arbitrum chain, an Ethereum L2 in Stage 1 according to L2BEAT.

> Chain score: M

## Upgradeability

The Uniswap DAO can change parameters such as fees through the `GorvernorBravoDelegator` contract.
Apart from the fees set by the governance, the protocol's contracts are immutable. No party is able to pause, revert trade execution, or otherwise change the behavior of the protocol.

No User funds nor unclaimed yield are affected by the remaining permissions.

Note that a `TransparentProxy` with the DAO as admin is used for the `NonFungibleTokenPositionDescriptor`, which is used for token descriptions.
However, this does not impact user funds or otherwise materially change the expected performance of the protocol.

> Upgradeabillity score: L

## Autonomy

There are no particular dependencies for the Uniswap protocol.

> Autonomy score: L

## Exit Window

No "Medium" or "High" risk permissions are found in the protocol that require protection with an Exit Window, but parameters such as protocol fees can be changed by the DAO. Note that the permissions controlled by the DAO are protected with a 1-week on-chain voting window and 2 to 30 days Exit Window for approved updates.

> Exit score: L

## Accessibility

Uniswap is accessible through multiple frontends. Uniswap offers main access through their main deployment: https://app.uniswap.org/. In addition to that,
the frontend app is also hosted on IPFS see here https://github.com/Uniswap/interface/releases. Further details on the maintenance and access of the interface hosted on IPFS can be found [here](https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-interface-ipfs). Additionally, users are offered the possibility to self host the frontend from here: https://github.com/Uniswap/interface.

| UniswapV3Factory                        | setOwner          | The setOwner function allows the current owner of the UniswapV3Factory contract to transfer ownership to a new address (_owner). This could lead to ownership takeover if abused.                                                                 | 0x2BAD8182C09F50c8318d769245beA52C32Be46CD |
| UniswapV3Factory                        | enableFeeAmount   | This function enables a new fee tier for pools by the owner. Incorrect tick spacing or fee settings could lead to operational or security vulnerabilities in the protocol.                                                                        | 0x2BAD8182C09F50c8318d769245beA52C32Be46CD |
| UniswapV3Factory(UniswapV3Pool)         | setFeeProtocol    | This function allows the factory owner to set the fee protocol parameters for token0 and token1. Misuse could lead to excessive fees, impacting users trading in the pool.                                                                        | 0x2BAD8182C09F50c8318d769245beA52C32Be46CD |
| UniswapV3Factory(UniswapV3Pool)         | collectProtocol   | This function allows the factory owner to withdraw accumulated protocol fees. If exploited, it could result in unauthorized withdrawal of fees, reducing the protocolâ€™s revenue and potentially affecting its ability to cover operational costs. | 0x2BAD8182C09F50c8318d769245beA52C32Be46CD |
| ProxyAdmin(Ownable)                     | renounceOwnership | This function allows the owner to relinquish ownership, leaving the contract without an owner. This disables all onlyOwner functions, making future administration impossible.                                                                    | 0x2BAD8182C09F50c8318d769245beA52C32Be46CD |
| ProxyAdmin(Ownable)                     | transferOwnership | This function allows the owner to transfer ownership to another address. If misused or compromised, ownership could be transferred to a malicious actor, leading to potential contract exploitation.                                              | 0x2BAD8182C09F50c8318d769245beA52C32Be46CD |
| ProxyAdmin                              | renounceOwnership | This function allows the owner to relinquish ownership, leaving the contract without an owner. This disables all onlyOwner functions, making future administration impossible.                                                                    | 0x2BAD8182C09F50c8318d769245beA52C32Be46CD |
| ProxyAdmin                              | transferOwnership | This function allows the owner to transfer ownership to another address. If misused or compromised, ownership could be transferred to a malicious actor, leading to potential contract exploitation.                                              | 0x2BAD8182C09F50c8318d769245beA52C32Be46CD |
| ProxyAdmin                              | changeProxyAdmin  | This function allows the admin of a proxy to be changed. If compromised, a malicious actor could take over proxy administration, leading to unauthorized upgrades or control.                                                                     | 0x2BAD8182C09F50c8318d769245beA52C32Be46CD |
| ProxyAdmin                              | upgrade           | This function allows upgrading the implementation of a proxy. A malicious upgrade could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior in the proxy's implementation.                                                                            | 0x2BAD8182C09F50c8318d769245beA52C32Be46CD |
| ProxyAdmin                              | upgradeAndCall    | Similar to upgrade, but also allows calling a function in the new implementation immediately after the upgrade. This increases the attack surface by enabling arbitrary execution during the upgrade process.                                     | 0x2BAD8182C09F50c8318d769245beA52C32Be46CD |
| ProxyAdmin(TransparentUpgradeableProxy) | changeAdmin       | Allows the admin of the proxy to be changed. If misused, control of the proxy could be transferred to a malicious actor, compromising all admin-controlled operations.                                                                            | 0xB753548F6E010e7e680BA186F9Ca1BdAB2E90cf2 |
| ProxyAdmin(TransparentUpgradeableProxy) | upgradeTo         | Allows the admin to upgrade the proxy to a new implementation. If exploited, a malicious implementation could be deployed, compromising the proxy's functionality.                                                                                | 0xB753548F6E010e7e680BA186F9Ca1BdAB2E90cf2 |
| ProxyAdmin(TransparentUpgradeableProxy) | upgradeToAndCall  | Similar to upgradeTo, but with the added risk of allowing arbitrary function calls during the upgrade. This can be exploited to execute malicious actions immediately after upgrading the implementation.                                         | 0xB753548F6E010e7e680BA186F9Ca1BdAB2E90cf2 |
| Ownable(TransparentUpgradeableProxy)    | renounceOwnership | This function allows the current owner to renounce ownership, leaving the contract ownerless. This could render the contract non-upgradable and restrict future changes, potentially locking funds or functionality.                              | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 |
| Ownable(TransparentUpgradeableProxy)    | transferOwnership | This function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to another address. If misused or called with an invalid address, it could lead to loss of control over the contract.                                                                | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 |
| ProxyAdmin(TransparentUpgradeableProxy) | renounceOwnership | Similar to Ownable.renounceOwnership, this function could leave the proxy administration without an owner, effectively disabling upgrades and admin changes for the proxy contract, creating operational and security risks.                      | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 |
| ProxyAdmin(TransparentUpgradeableProxy) | transferOwnership | This function enables the transfer of ownership of the proxy administration to a new address. An incorrect transfer could compromise control over all associated proxies, leading to potential exploitation.                                      | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 |
| TransparentUpgradeableProxy             | admin             | This function allows the admin to view the current admin address of the proxy. If improperly secured, it could expose sensitive details or allow unauthorized access to privileged functions.                                                     | 0xb753548f6e010e7e680ba186f9ca1bdab2e90cf2 |
| TransparentUpgradeableProxy             | implementation    | This function reveals the address of the current implementation contract. If improperly secured, it could expose sensitive implementation details, potentially allowing attackers to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the logic.           | 0xb753548f6e010e7e680ba186f9ca1bdab2e90cf2 |

## Dependencies

No external dependency has been found.

## Exit Window

As the contracts are immutable the users can always withdraw their funds, but parameters such as protocol
fees can be changed by the DAO. A `Timelock` protects the contracts and updates are governed by the `GovernorBravo` contract.
The lock period is at least two days and up to 30 days for governance actions.
When a proposal is created (at least 2.5M Uni), the community can cast their votes during a 3 day voting period. If a majority, and at least 4M votes are cast for the proposal, it is queued in the Timelock, and may be executed in a minimum of 2 days.

# Security Council

No security council needed because on-chain governance is in place.
